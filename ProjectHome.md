A group of PC utilities for the Tandy Color Computer (Coco) and its clones, such as the Prologica CP 400.

This project's primary features will be:

- PAK to CAS and CAS to WAV conversions
- Image Conversion Tool for the CoCo
- Sound Utilities for the CoCo

The main focus here is on the CoCo 1/2. Most stuff here could (theoretically) work in the CoCo 3.
